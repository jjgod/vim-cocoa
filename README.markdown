vim-cocoa
=========

What is vim-cocoa?
------------------

vim-cocoa is a Mac OS X native vim GUI implementation in Cocoa, it started
as a Google Summer of Code 2007 project, it's now maintaining by Jjgod Jiang
<gzjjgod@gmail.com>.

Build instructions
------------------

  git clone https://github.com/jjgod/vim-cocoa.git
  cd vim-cocoa
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../src
  make
  ./Vim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g

What's the differences between the original vim, MacVim and vim-cocoa?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The original [vim](http://www.vim.org) (checkout from vim official Subversion
repository) only provides a Classic/Carbon based GUI for Mac OS X users, it
lacks some important features and does not give us the best GUI experiences.

Thus, both [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/MacVim) and vim-cocoa started
to alleviate this problem by reimplement the whole Mac GUI with Cocoa,
MacVim started earlier, in 2006, but the author (Bj√∂rn Winkler) didn't
announce it at that time. After it's matured enough to be announced, vim-cocoa
is already accepted as a Google Summer of Code project and I (Jjgod Jiang)
already started coding, although these two projects started with the same
goal, there are a lot of differences in their design decisions, which made
their code base not so possible to merge together.

In short, MacVim is a more feature-rich, more Mac-integrated version, while
vim-cocoa follows a more simple, lightweight and fast approach.

Nico Weber has a nice
[introduction](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_mac/browse_thread/thread/c16868aa7dcad59b)
on which MacVim does but vim-cocoa doesn't (I discussed a bit about my design
goals for vim-cocoa too).
